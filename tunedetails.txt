ColourReconnection:
      >>reconnect: Allow or not a system to be merged with another
      >>mode: Model for colour reconnection. option 0 = MPI-Based Original Pythia8; 1 = new QCD Based scheme. SHOULD BE COMBINED WITH BeamRemnants:remnantMode = 1
	range: Higher this number, more reconnections can occur (0,10)
	m0: lambda measure for string length (def=0.3, (0.1,5))
      >>junctionCorrection: allows to use a different m0 for junction strings in the lambda measure. It is multiplicative correction to the m0 chosen above. (0.01,10)
	timeDilationMode: (def=2 (0,5)) Disallow colour reconnection between strings not in causal contact.
      >>timeDilationPar: Tuneable parameter for time dilation (0,100)
ParticleDecays:
	(Tau: Proper lifetime of particle, in mm/c. Used by pythia to determine whether a particle should be allowed to decay)
	(Tau0: nominal lifetime in mm/c.)
      >>tau0Max: Upper limit of nominal lifetime
      >>limitTau0: Only particles with tau0<tau0Max decay
PartonLevel:
	MPI: (def = on) Master switch for multiparton interactions
      >>earlyResDec: If on, do resonance decays early, before beam handling including colour reconnection. If off, decays done afterwards, so unaffected by CR.
HadronLevel:
	HadronScatter: (def = off) Switch for hadron rescatterring, following hadronisation
MultiPartonInteractions: <<< interesting parameters
	alphaSvalue: (def = 0.130 (0.06,0.25)) value of strong coupling
      >>pT0Ref: (def = 2.28, (0.5,10)) value is tied to a number of choices, such as that of colour flow description, so is difficult to give an independent meaning
	bProfile: (def = 3 (0,4)) Choice of impact parameter profile (+ free parameters)
	allowRescatter: (def = off) allow rescattering of partons (not well tested)
	rescatterMode: (def = 0, (0,4))
PartonVertex:
      >>setVertex: (def = off) Allow setting of partonic vertices
	modeVertex: (def = 2, (1,2)) 1: proton profile is uniform black disk; 2: proton profile is 2D Gaussian
      >>protonRadius: (def = 0.7, (0,10)) According to DIPSY model, at 14TeV proton radius ~ 0.7 fm
      >>emissionWidth: (def = 0.1, (0,10)) Determines overall strength of the transverse space smearing
	pTmin: (def = 0.2, (0.05,1)) Parton transverse smearing proportional to 1/pT, but pT limited to above pTmin to avoid unreasonable values
Ropewalk:
      >>RopeHadronization: (def = off) Swtich for all aspects of rope hadronisation. Note: few (or no?) tunes with rope hadronization (??)
      >>doShoving: (def = off) Enable string shoving mechanism (with an interaction potential derived from the colour superconductor analogy)
      >>doFlavour: (def = off) At hadronisation, colours at string endpoints and in gluon kinks can form a rope, which is hadronised with a larger string tension
      >>r0: (def = 0.5, (0,10)) transverse radius of string in fm. Viewed as overall strength param. of rope hadronisation.
      >>m0: (def = 0.2, (0.01,5))  Imposed lower mass cutoff to allow for calculation of rapidities of dipoles composed of massless gluons.
   (shoving settings)
      >>rCutOff: (def = 6, (0,100)) Max cut off radius at which strings stop interacting (to decrease computation time). No variation for values above def.
      >>gAmplitude: (def = 5, (0,100)) Amplitude of shoving force. Min Bias/UE observables, transverse vars are sensitive. Changing gAmplitude requires retuning MPI
      >>gExponent: (def = 1, (0,100)) Multiplies string radius in shoving force, allowing for variation between radius in rope flavour and shoving treatments
      >>deltay: (def = 0.2, (0.01,10)) Width of rapidity slices in which event is split before shoving
      >>tShove: (def = 1, (0,100)) Total shoving time in fm/c
      >>deltat: (def = 0.1, (0.01,100)) Size of steps taken in time during shoving.
      >>tInit: (def = 1.5, (0,100)) Strings allowed to propagate before shoving (fm/c).
      >>limitMom: (def = on) switch off shoving for diploes with pT above pTcut.
      >>pTcut: (def = 2.0, (0,1000)) value of pT at which shoving is turned off if limitMom is on
   (flavour settings)
      >>beta: (def = 0.2, (0,1)) detemines how much StringFlav:probQQtoQ scales with string tension (?)
	setFixedKappa: (def=0ff) ignore generator spacetime info., using only a provided string tension, eg. or toy studies of hadronisation in dense environments
        presetKappa: (def=0, (0,100)) Effective string tension calculation using string overlaps ignored. By setting setFixedKappa, presetKappa is used instead
StringFlav:
	kappa: (def = 0.2, (0,10)) (For use in rope flavour model) A based value of string tension to allow for studies of exotic quark production in rope model
	probQQtoQ: (def =0.081, (0,1)) Suprpression of diquark production relative to quark production (ie. Baryon relative to meson)
	(probStoUD, probSQtoQQ, probQQ1toQQ0, probQQ1toQQ0join)
	mesonCvector: (def=0.88, (0,3)) relative prod. ratio vector/pseudoscalar for charm mesons (mesonUDvector, mesonSvector, mesonBvector)
	BtoMratio: (def = 0.357, (0.1,10)) Ratio of rate of baryon to meson production (multiplies every baryon Clebsch-Gordan coef.)
